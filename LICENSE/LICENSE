|    PREAMBLE.  Based on the MIT license, the Telework Common License aims to  |
| promote best parts of open source by making Software fully and freely        |
| accessible to everyone for non-commercial purposes, while simultaneously     |
| enabling software developers to easily monetize their work by requiring that |
| Corporations and other enterprise users pay for an enterprise license after  |
| a year of for-profit use.                                                    |
